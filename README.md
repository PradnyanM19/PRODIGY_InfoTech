Task 1 - This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms. The notebook guides users through the entire process, including data preparation, model training, evaluation, and prediction. The dataset is loaded and preprocessed, followed by training the linear regression model. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error and R^2 Score. Additionally, a prediction function is provided to allow users to input new data and obtain house price predictions. The repository requires pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and Jupyter Notebook to run.

Task 2 - This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a K-means clustering algorithm to group retail store customers based on their purchase history. The notebook includes steps for data preparation, applying the K-means algorithm, and evaluating and visualizing the resulting clusters. Users can see how customers are segmented based on features such as AnnualIncome and SpendingScore, providing valuable insights into customer behavior. The repository requires pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn to run.

Task 3 - This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset. The notebook guides users through the process of data loading, preprocessing, feature extraction, and applying the SVM algorithm for classification. It includes steps for splitting the data into training and testing sets, training the SVM model, and evaluating its performance. The repository requires pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and image processing libraries such as OpenCV or PIL to run.

Task 4 - This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that develops a hand gesture recognition model to accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data. The notebook includes steps for data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, and training a convolutional neural network (CNN) for gesture recognition. It aims to enable intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems. The repository requires libraries such as pandas, numpy, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, and scikit-learn to run.

Task 5 - This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that develops a model to accurately recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content. The notebook includes steps for data collection, image preprocessing, feature extraction, and training a convolutional neural network (CNN) for food recognition. Additionally, it integrates a database of nutritional information to estimate calorie content, enabling users to track their dietary intake and make informed food choices. The repository requires libraries such as pandas, numpy, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, and scikit-learn to run.
